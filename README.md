# Disease mapping using standardised mortality/morbidity ratios (SMR)

This was an MSc assignment with the purpose of investigating England's hospital admission rates for COPD (2001-2010).

## Objectives: 

- Summarise number of hospital admissions for COPD in England between 2001 and 2010
- Estimate raw and smoothed standardised morbidity ratios (SMR) and look for any spatial patterns 
- Investigate any changes in the risks of hospitalisation due to COPD in England over time
- Consider this scenorio:a government minister wants to increase resources to hospitals to cope with admissions for COPD, recommend key areas/local authorities in England where these resources should be allocated  

## Files 

- R file with my analysis
- copdobserved.csv and copdexpected.csv are the datasets used for this project
- shapefile folder containing shapefiles used to create maps

### Report containing recommendations (within Conclusion/Recommendations section) can be found on my github page : https://jhfran.github.io/copd
